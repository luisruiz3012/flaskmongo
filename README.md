# flaskmongo
This is a basic bash shell script to help everyone using the flask and pymongo library to help you get your project basic dependencies and virtual environment with just one command


# Install
- Clone the repository on your bin folder: git clone https://github.com/luisruiz3012/flaskmongo.git
- Enable exec option to the flaskmongo.sh file by using: chmod +x flaskmongo.sh
- Use "source flaskmongo.sh" to activate this option
- Open flaskmongo.sh on your favourite text editor and replace the FILEPATH value for the route of your projects/documents folder, then save the file


# Using flaskmongo
- Type flaskmongo.sh and press enter
- Then enter your project name and hit enter
- Once you hit enter, your project folder would be created on the path that you previously assigned on the flaskmongo.sh file, it would create your virtual environment and install the flask, flask_mongo and flask_cors dependencies so you can get started
